let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing
Answer
// Line 3; when we the right side first count in the right side is considerd as 0 so 0+1 will be 1.

// Therfore if we write the same code in next line the result is not one but 2
